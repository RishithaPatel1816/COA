# COA
- **CPU** is like brain of the compurer.
- It has AlU(Arithematic Logic Unit),CU(Control unit), Registers(to store values.

### What is Computer Architecture?
1. It tells computer what to do.
2. How fast it can do.
3. How it can interact with I/O devices.
### What is Computer Organization
- How CPU, memory and other parts are connected to follow the architecture(that we have designed).

## ISA 
**ISA**: Instruction Set Architecture
- It is like a contract between software and hardware.
- **STATE OF THE PROGRAM**: It will define functional definitions of operations, modes, and storage locations that are supported by hardware.
- This will include Interrupt model, Memory mode(which u will come across later
- **What Instructions do**: Semantics of instructions like how they are updated etc..
- **How Instructions are represented**: Syntax(bit encodings)
- But it will not tell how they are implemented, which operations are fastand which are slow.
- It won't tell which operations take more power and which takes less
- ISA is basically a set of instruction that can be executed.
- To make an ISA one should see
1. Programmability (easy to expess the programS efficiently).
    - Using compilers we can express the programs efficiently.
    - ISA with low level fine grained instructions are preferred
3. Implementablilty (Easy to design high performance implementations.)
4. Compatability (Easy to maintain programmability as languages/programs nd technoloogy evolve)
